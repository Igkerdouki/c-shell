# Unix Shell (C)

This project implements a simple Unix-style shell similar to bash.

It supports executing programs, maintaining command history,
and running script files.

Features:
- Command parsing
- fork/exec process creation
- History management
- Script execution

Built in C as part of a systems programming course.
All shell and process logic was written by me.

What I learned:
- Process control
- fork / exec
- Signals and I/O
- OS-level debugging
